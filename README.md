### Description This is my Indepedent Week 4 Project on David's Gallery App.
#### As a user, I want to be able to upload photos from a folder then on clicking submit the files are loaded in to the image folder and also my database.In addition,when I search the image on the same site,I should be able to get the results of the image.

#### I have been built this web page using "ejs": "^3.1.8",express: "^4.18.2",mongoose: "^6.8.4",multer: "^1.4.5-lts.1",nodemon: "^2.0.20"visual studio code,HTML,Javascript,bootsrap,css,jQuery, git bash and then uploading on Github.

### BDD -The behavior that we'll need to write code to handle. 
####    -A sample of input that would demonstrate the behavior.

### Setup/Installation Requirements
#### User Story
#### The user should see a landing page when visiting the site for the first time. The landing page should display a file upload form.
#### By choosing an image file to upload and submitting the form, the image should be uploaded to http://domain/upload. The image should be displayed on the landing page and the user redirected to the landing page. The user can upload several images and create a gallery on the landing page.
#### Once on the landing page, the user can select a specific image, then they get routed to a page that displays that image and the image details.
#### On the single imageâ€™s page, the user has the option to update the Image information such as the name of the picture.
#### The user can also search the image and the image will no longer be displayed on the landing page
